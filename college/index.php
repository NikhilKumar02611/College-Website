            <p>A college tour, also called a campus tour, is a tour of a college campus. Prospective

              facilities, as well as student life, culture on campus, academics, and programs offered by
              the institution. During these tours, prospective students are able to learn about the built environment
              and the overall look and feel of the institution. Campus tours are usually free, as they promote the
              institution and encourage prospective students to attend the college. Often, colleges may give visitors
              T-shirts or other gifts for taking a tour.</p>
